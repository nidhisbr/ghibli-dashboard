This project is a full-stack web application built using React and Spring Boot, focusing on secure authentication and authorization using JWT.It demonstrates a real-world login/signup flow, protected APIs, and frontend route protection commonly used in enterprise applications.

🚀 Features
User Signup & Login with JWT-based authentication
Spring Security for securing REST APIs
MongoDB integration for persistent user and application data
Protected routes on frontend using React Router
Secure API communication using Axios with Bearer tokens
Asynchronous Data Fetching: Seamlessly retrieves film and character data from a custom API endpoint.
Film Catalog Browsing: Displays all films in a clean, scrollable grid interface.
Detailed Film Views: Users can navigate to dedicated pages to see film descriptions, director, producer, and cast/character lists.
Responsive Design: Optimized layout for an intuitive experience across mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports.
Client-Side Routing: Fast, smooth navigation powered by React Router.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
